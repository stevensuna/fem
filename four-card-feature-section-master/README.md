## My Process

### Built With
- **Semantic HTML5 markup**
- **CSS custom properties & design tokens:** Colors are managed using HSL for intuitive control, typography uses rem for accessibility, and box model properties (padding, margin, border) use pixels.
- **Mobile-first responsive CSS**
- **BEM methodology for class naming**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** for interactivity
- **Simple file organization:**
  - `/index.html` for the main document
  - `/css` for stylesheets
  - `/js` for JavaScript files
  - `/assets` for images and media
  - `/pages` for additional HTML pages

### What I Learned

- **Accessibility and Typography:** I refined my approach to use rem for all typographic properties, which ensures better accessibility and scalability across different devices.
- **Box Model Precision:** Using pixels for padding, margin, and borders provided more intuitive control over element spacing.
- **Effective Use of CSS Custom Properties:** The adoption of HSL for colors and custom properties for design tokens improved maintainability.
- **Responsive Design:** The mobile-first approach was essential. I ensured the design scales properly by using responsive breakpoints and semantic class names (following BEM).

### Commit Message History

I maintained a detailed commit history to capture my process:
- **Initial Commit:** Set up project structure and basic HTML/CSS.
- **Mobile-First Styling:** Implemented a mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints.
- **CSS Adjustments:** Updated typography to use rem and box model properties to use pixels based on accessibility and intuitive design guidelines.
- **Feature Enhancements:** Added BEM class structure and updated the color palette to use HSL.
- **Bug Fixes & Refactoring:** Improved browser compatibility and optimized file organization.
- **Final Touches:** Updated README and polished remaining styles.

### Continued Development

Future improvements may include:
- Enhancing interactivity with more advanced JavaScript.
- Further optimizations for performance and file size.
- Experimenting with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Improving accessibility features based on audit feedback.
