# Frontend Mentor Challenges

Welcome to my collection of projects! These projects are part of my journey to improve my front-end development skills. Each project is a challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), a platform that offers real-world projects to help developers hone their skills.

## Why Frontend Mentor?

Frontend Mentor provides a wide range of challenges that mimic real-world projects. By working on these challenges, I am able to:
- Practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills
- Learn and implement responsive design techniques
- Gain experience with modern front-end tools and frameworks
- Build a portfolio of projects to showcase my skills
