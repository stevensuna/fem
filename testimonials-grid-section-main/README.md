## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:  
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.  
- Experience a clean, accessible, and responsive layout built with semantic HTML and modern CSS.

## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5** – Clean, accessible markup.
- **Mobile-First Responsive CSS** – Layout adapts from mobile to desktop.
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** – For precise positioning and spacing.
- **CSS Custom Properties** – For theming (colors, spacing, typography).
- **Version Control with Git** – Keeping incremental, meaningful commits.

### What I Learned

- **Responsive Design Techniques:** Using CSS Grid and custom properties to adjust layouts on various screen sizes.
- **CSS Spacing and Theming:** Implementing a mathematical progression for spacing (using variables like `--space-md`) and an accessible color scheme with HSL.
- **Git Workflow:** How to revert changes safely when needed and maintain clear commit messages.
